considerations select each button. then, select next to continue. toxic noxious corrosive flammable oxidizer explosive  toxic toxic many precursor chemicals are potentially harmful if ingested or if absorbed through the skin. never drink or eat around precursor chemicals, and be careful not to handle them in any capacity.   corrosive corrosive chemicals can cause damage to the skin if not handled safely. sulfic acid is one example of a material with corrosive properties. however, be aware that some other substances may be corrosive only under certain circumstances or when found in combination with other chemicals. corrosive  flammable the flammability of hme and precursor chemicals varies widely. some of these substances may be ignited by as little as a small spark, while others require sustained exposure to flames before a reaction occurs. it is often not possible to predict what level of exposure could ignite these substances, as it varies considerably depending on the methods used for production. flammable  oxidizer some precursor chemicals are oxidizers. they are a fire hazard because they can cause combustible materials to ignite more easily by lowering flashpoints and ignition temperatures, enhance combustion, and widen the flammable range of flammable gases and liquids. oxidizer  explosive you may sometimes encounter precursor chemicals that have already been combined to form an explosive material. it is not always easy to recognize this, so extreme caution should be exercised when you suspect the presence of hme or their precursor chemicals. explosive  noxious many precursor chemicals are dangerous if inhaled and can cause a range of symptoms from shortness of breath to permanent lung damage or even death. the potential for precursor chemicals to be noxious necessitates swift evacuation in cases where suspect substances are present. do not open doors or windows to attempt to dissipate the chemicals. noxious </slidetext><slidetext

faq 3 are there programs that prevent  the sale of precursor chemicals? faq 3 are there programs that prevent  the sale of precursor chemicals? answer answer  despite their added danger, homemade explosives have several advantages for individuals wanting to cause harm. they are easier to acquire, and it is also easier to conceal intent by purchasing precursor chemicals that are less likely to alert authorities to an impending attack. faq 2 why would individuals choose  hme over other options? faq 2 why would individuals choose  hme over other options?   in addition to being largely homemade and often more readily available, homemade explosives differ from military and commercial explosives in that they are frequently less stable and more likely to react unexpectedly. some homemade explosives are particularly dangerous and have been known to explode with only light handling or after being dropped. terrorists aren’t the only people injuring themselves either. every year, dozens of people injure themselves or others while experimenting with homemade explosives.  faq 1 how is hme different from  commercial or military explosives? faq 1 how is hme different from  commercial or military explosives?  obp offers a community outreach program called the bomb-making materials awareness program (bmap). bmap is a government-industry partnership to prevent terrorism by securing chemicals that can be used to make homemade explosives used in improvised explosive devices (ieds). many chemicals are so common that it is impractical to regulate their sale, which terrorists and criminals exploit. through this voluntary program, bmap educates industry partners to prevent the misuse of these chemicals by: building a network of aware and vigilant partners throughout the private sector;  inventory and sales transaction security awareness; and suspicious activity reporting. these employees then help to serve as the “nation’s eyes and ears,” acting as force multipliers in detecting and reporting suspicious activity. for more information visit: www.dhs.gov/bomb-making-materials-awareness-program. faq 3 are there programs that prevent  the sale of

case study case study case study  criminals case study escondido, california 2010 the “bomb factory” case george djura jakubec was arrested by law enforcement after a gardener at his residence was injured by an accidental explosion of highly volatile explosive material in jakubec’s backyard. a federal indictment charged jakubec with eight counts relating to the unlawful manufacture and possession of destructive devices at his escondido, california residence, the robbery or attempted robbery of four san diego county banks, and possessing a firearm during and in relation to two of those bank robberies. jakubec pled guilty. specifically regarding the destructive devices charge, jakubec admitted that he illegally manufactured and possessed certain high explosives, including

mixtures peroxide mixtures peroxide mixtures peroxide mixtures  peroxide mixtures appearance: often a white crystal. odor: unique, strong chemical smell. examples: triacetone triperoxide (tatp) and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (hmtd).  precursors may be derived from: pool sanitizers, hair coloring, teeth-whitening products, antiseptics. notes: peroxide-based mixtures are often created from household detergents and bleaches.  hydrogen peroxide, along with other organic peroxides, mixed with other precursors can create an hme that is extremely sensitive to shock and external stimuli, making the mixture very dangerous.  peroxide-based hme mixtures may self-detonate, depending on environmental factors. peroxide-based hmes also have low shelf lives and are often found as white powders or liquids.   nitrate mixtures nitrate mixtures nitrate mixtures nitrate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures peroxide mixtures   peroxide case study: paris, 2015 the attackers who carried out the attacks in paris on november 13, 2015 used triacetone triperoxide, or tatp. tatp is manufactured using hydrogen peroxide, among other ingredients.  tatp is very unstable and dangerous if mishandled. in the case of the paris attacks, the tatp that was included in the attackers’ suicide vests successfully detonated in most of the vests.  nitrate mixtures nitrate mixtures nitrate mixtures nitrate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures peroxide mixtures mourners pay  tribute responders at  the scene location where a suicide  vest was found after the  paris attacks  chlorate/perchlorate mixtures appearance: in pure form, white or off-white powders or crystals. can be any color when mixed with other substances. may be found dissolved in liquid, as in kerosene. odor: typically odorless. examples: ammonium perchlorate, sodium perchlorate (kerosene), potassium chlorate (nitrobenzene). precursors may be derived from: strike-anywhere matches, fireworks, model rocket motors, pool shock. notes: chlorate-based mixtures are created from the chemical reaction of chlorine and oxygen. production of chlorate-based mixtures often begins with the breakdown of liquid bleaches or water-purification additives to extract the pure chlorine. when mixed with various hydroxides, chlorate/perchlorate is produced. chlorate-based mixtures can be components of both main charges and initiators.  many chlorate-based mixtures are oxidizers of varying strengths and are blended with fuels and potentially binders. some are relatively insensitive to a reaction, while others are highly unstable.   nitrate mixtures nitrate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures peroxide mixtures peroxide mixtures peroxide mixtures  nitrate mixtures nitrate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures peroxide mixtures peroxide mixtures exploded remains from the ied fireworks used to build ied chlorate/perchlorate case study: boston, 2013 on april 15, 2013, improvised explosive devices made with a model car remote control, christmas lights, shrapnel, and fireworks were used in pressure cookers and detonated near the boston marathon finish line by tamerian and dzhokhar tsarnaev. potassium perchlorate, collected from commercially available fireworks, were used in the attack that killed three and wounded hundreds of others.  nitrate case study: oklahoma city, 1995 on april 19, 1995, a ryder truck parked outside the alfred p. murrah building exploded, killing 168 people, among them 19 children who attended a daycare housed within the building.  the primary attacker was later identified as timothy mcveigh, a violent anti-government extremist. according to jim norman, a case agent for this incident, the explosive device was approximately 5,000 pounds of explosive material, which included 4,500 of ammonium nitrate and 300 pounds of tovex that was used as a booster. the device also included three 53-gallon barrels of nitromethane fuel that was mixed with the ammonium nitrate to create ammonium nitrate fuel oil (anfo). the total cost for this device was estimated at $3,450.  nitrate mixtures

showing the ryder truck  notes: fertilizer-based mixtures normally require a booster for initiation, as they are relatively insensitive to shock and external stimulus. fertilizer-based mixtures appear white, yellowish, tan, or pink, and smell like the fuel used.  nitrate mixtures appearance: color and form varies. can be found in liquid, crystal, or prill form. odor: may be similar to fuel used. for example, may smell like diesel fuel. in some cases, as when mixed with aluminum powder, may be odorless. examples: ammonium nitrate (an), nitroglycerin (ng), urea nitrate, erythritol tetranitrate (etn).  precursors may be derived from: lawn fertilizer, cold packs. nitrate mixtures nitrate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures chlorate/ perchlorate mixtures peroxide mixtures peroxide mixtures

various hme powders. examples: mortar/pestle, coffee grinders, and ball mills.  mixers and stirrers mixers blend solid components, while stirrers blend liquid components. mixers are commonly used to produce hme powders, while stirrers are used to blend many hme liquids, such as hmtd. examples: common cooking baking mixers (like a kitchenaid) and blenders. stirrers may also come in the form of magnetic stirrers or large buckets.   ice baths ice baths cool mixtures that generate heat. many hme mixtures that are heat sensitive may require ice baths to keep them cool. examples: bathtubs, keeping containers in ice chests or coolers, or dry ice.  cookers certain hme mixtures may require heating to chemically combine precursors. examples: slow cookers and pressure cookers.   filters filters separate the solids from the liquids and are commonly used in the production of peroxide mixtures. examples: filter funnels, coffee filters, and cloth filters.   scales to properly measure out proportions of hme precursors, it is often necessary to weigh the ingredients to exact measures. examples: chemical scales that have near-exact accuracy to the hundredth of a gram.  drying equipment certain hme mixtures require proper drying during the production process. examples: laying a tarp out in the sunlight and placing the hme precursors or mixtures on the tarp.  safety equipment safety equipment provides personal protection for the individual during the production process.  examples: gloves, masks, aprons, and goggles.  distillers distillers concentrate chemical components with low-level heat. examples: complex scientific equipment, like a rotovap, or household items used in improvised methods, such as a hotplate or a coffee plate. </slidetext><slidetext
